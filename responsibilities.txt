1. Data preprocessing - recursive loading, setting labels, cleaning audios, generating spectrograms, etc. 

Maksym Nosal, Chika Libuku, Larisa Salamatova, Arsenii Ostapyk

P.S. Separate functions were implemented by different people. 

2. Exploratory Data Analysis - Maksym Nosal, Chika Libuku, Arsenii Ostapyk 

3. Models batching, datasets, loaders, train_test_split, train the input model, evaluate (f1 score), confusion matrix, 2D PCA + Means for clustering - Maksym Nosal, Chika Libuku, Larisa Salamatova

4. Models building - CNN - Maksym Nosal

5. UX/UI - front.py + additional feature to loop over short audios in order to be able to handle shorter audios - Arsenii Ostapyk 

6. Saving models, loading models in order to be able to use them further with our rerunning the training process - Maksym Nosal, Chika Libuku

7. Finding the easiest samples for a model (0.000000 loss), the most difficult ones (big loss) -  Maksym Nosal, Chika Libuku, Arsenii Ostapyk, Daria Mudragel
